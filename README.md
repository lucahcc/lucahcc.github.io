# Weather Search Application üå¶Ô∏è

This project represents a **progressive development journey**, evolving from a simple static webpage to an advanced web and mobile application:

1. **Part 1**: A fully static webpage showcasing basic weather information.
2. **Part 2**: Uploading the code to a cloud platform to enable real-time data interaction.
3. **Part 3**: Transforming the application into a modern, feature-rich website using frameworks such as Angular, Node.js, and Bootstrap.
4. **Part 4**: Developing an Android version of the application for mobile users.

Through these stages, the project integrates various advanced technologies to enhance functionality, scalability, and user experience.
